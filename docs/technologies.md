## Technologies

You'll learn some of these technologies and libraries.

### The Basic

- **[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)**: the programming language
- **[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)**: the markup language
- **[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)**: the styling language
- **[GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)**: the most popular [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

### The Platforms

- **[Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome)/[Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)/[Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge)**: the browsers you now and love, they execute the front-end code of your websites
- **[Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)**: allows JS to be run outside of browsers, you'll use it for writing desktop/CLI apps and back-end code
- **[Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework))**: it allows you to write desktop apps
- **[Cordova/PhoneGap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova)**: it allows you to write mobile apps

### The Ecosystem

- **[NPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software))**: it stands for Node Package Manager, it's a way of sharing your packages with others and using other people's packages
- **[Webpack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack)**: the most popular module bundler out there, it bundles all the files composing your application into a single one
- **[lodash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodash)**: the best collection of utilities available for JS

### UI Libraries

There are a variaty of libraries for writing UIs, with new ones maybe being published right now!

- **[jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)**: this is the old (but gold?) way of making UIs in an imperative way
- **[React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))**: this is the new way of making UIs, in a declarative way, this is the library I'm currently using for any new app
- **[Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(application_platform))/[VueJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js)**: similar to React, but instead of writing your "HTML" into your JS they kind of enhance your HTML, it's weird IMHO, but many people love it

### The Advanced

You don't _need_ to learn these, but eventually, as you write more complex apps you'll probably _want_ to.

- **[TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript)**: JS is not particularly well suited for big codebases, for that you should use TypeScript, which is a super-set of JavaScript, it's basically JavaScript with types
- **[JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#JSX)**: there are some UI libraries, like React, which require you to write HTML inside JS. JSX is the special-purpose language for doing that
- **[SASS/SCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language))**: CSS is cumbersome to write, you can't even nest rules, SASS/SCSS solves that
