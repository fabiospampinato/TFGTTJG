## Technologies

You'll learn some of these technologies and libraries.

### The Basic

- **JavaScript**: the programming language
- **HTML**: the markup language
- **CSS**: the styling language
- **GIT**: the most popular Version Control System

### The Platforms

- **Chrome/Firefox/Edge**: the browsers you now and love, they execute the front-end code of your websites
- **Node.js**: allows JS to be run outside of browsers, you'll use it for writing desktop/CLI apps and back-end code
- **Electron**: it allows you to write desktop apps
- **Cordova/PhoneGap**: they allow you to write mobile apps

### The Ecosystem

- **NPM**: it stands for Node Package Manager, it's a way of sharing your packages with others and using other people's packages
- **Webpack**: the most popular module bundler out there, it bundles all the files composing your application into a single one
- **lodash**: the best collection of utilities available for JS

### UI Libraries

There are a variaty of libraries for writing UIs, with new ones maybe being published right now!

- **jQuery**: this is the old (but gold?) way of making UIs in an imperative way
- **React**: this is the new way of making UIs, in a declarative way, this is the library I'm currently using for any new app
- **Angular/VueJS**: similar to React, but instead of writing your "HTML" into your JS they kind of enhance your HTML, it's weird IMHO, but many people love it

### The Advanced

You don't _need_ to learn these, but eventually, as you write more complex apps you'll probably _want_ to.

- **TypeScript**: JS is not particularly well suited for big codebases, for that you should use TypeScript, which is a super-set of JavaScript, it's basically JavaScript with types
- **JSX**: there are some UI libraries, like React, which require you to write HTML inside JS. JSX is the special-purpose language for doing that
- **SCSS**: CSS is cumbersome to write, you can't even nest rules, SCSS solves that
